## Introduction
Hello! My name is **Emma Sexton**, and I am currently a second-year graduate student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in the Heilbrunn Department of Population and Family Health with a certificate in Public Health Research Methods. My current coursework merges human rights-based frameworks with quantitative and qualitative data analysis to accurately conduct research and needs assessments and effectively create, implement, and manage public health programs. With a profound concern for the individual and community on the local, regional, and global scale, I have a particular interest in analyzing the social and environmental factors that impact maternal health and child development.
